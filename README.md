# Oklahoma-Seismic-Analysis---Wastewater-Injection-Well-Correlation
The purpose of this project is to investigate the link between oil and gas industry injection wells in Oklahoma and earthquake activity in the area and determine if the number of future earthquakes near an  active injection well may be predicted based on well location, injection depth, underlying rock formation, and injection pressures and volumes. The Oklahoma  Corporation Comission (OCC) requires that injection well owners submit data  giving the monthly injection volume and pressure for all wastewater disposal  and enhanced revoery wells in the state. That data is publicly available from  2011 to 2017 (http://www.occeweb.com/og/ogdatafiles2.htm). The number and  location of earthquakes of Magnitude 2.5 or greater recorded in Oklahoma were  also obtained through the United States Geological Survey for 2017 (USGS) at  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search.
